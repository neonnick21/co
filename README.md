# RF-DETR Object Detection Project

This repository implements the RF-DETR model for object detection, including data preparation, model training, evaluation, and reporting.

## Project Structure

- `data/` - Dataset images and annotations
    - `images/train/`, `images/val/`, `images/test/`
    - `annotations/` (COCO format JSON files)
- `src/` - Source code
    - `data_preprocessing.py` - Data download, conversion, augmentation
    - `model/` - Model implementation (DETR, RF-DETR modules)
    - `train.py` - Training loop
    - `evaluate.py` - Evaluation and visualization
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for exploration
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `README.md` - Project overview and instructions

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Download and prepare the dataset (see instructions in `data_preprocessing.py`).
3. Train the model:
   ```
   python src/train.py
   ```
4. Evaluate and visualize results:
   ```
   python src/evaluate.py
   ```

# RF-DETR Object Detection Pipeline

## How to Run the Full Pipeline

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Data Preparation**
   - Run the data preprocessing script to download, split, resize, and augment the dataset:
   ```sh
   python src/data_preprocessing.py
   ```

3. **Model Training**
   - Train the RF-DETR model:
   ```sh
   python src/train.py
   ```
   - The best model will be saved as `rfdetr_best.pth`.

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the trained model and visualize predictions:
   ```sh
   python src/evaluate.py
   ```
   - This will print precision, recall, IoU, and mAP, and show/save prediction visualizations.
